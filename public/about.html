    <h1>About The Yashio Kenya</h1>
    <p>Our vision is "Realizing a world where people can create their own future".</p>
    <p>We are going to build schools all over the world to realize it.</p>
    <p>We believe that the essence of education is to provide the “Survival Intelligence”
        necessary for society.</p>
    <p>We came from Japan to provide skills and jobs to Kenyans.</p>
    <p>We provide a service called "Skilled". We provide a range of services from the
        development of educational content ,systems , to post-learning job support for persons.</p>
    <p>We welcome anyone who can help us achieve this goal.</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
